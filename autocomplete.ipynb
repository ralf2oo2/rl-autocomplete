    "## RL Autocomplete\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I'm going to show my process of making a reinforcement learning agent that will guess the next letter in a string and potentially use it for autocomplete. I decided to do this project because I wanted to do a non gaming related reinforcement learning project. I know that there are better ways to do autocomplete but I'm curious if reinforcement learning would work. The project will be using a PPO model that I will create using pytorch and chatgpt. The reason for this choice is because I used a PPO model in my previous project and I want to get a better understanding of how it works"

    "First I made the pytorch module. Initially I was using convolutional layers in my module but those are usually used for pattern recognision like machine vision. I learned about convolutional layers so it wasn't too bad. I found that most people use linear layers so my module also uses linear layers. If at any point the module seems to be insufficient I will update it.\n",

    "Before starting on the autocomplete agent I wanted to test if the PPO agent even works. It would be annoying if I didn't know if a bug was caused by my agent or my training. I created a script for loading a gymnasium environment and training the PPO agent. An interesting thing to note from the script is that the agent only gets trained after 50 experiences. this is because of the way PPO works. first the agent will collect an amount of experiences based on the current policy and then the agent gets trained on those experiences. unlike Q-learning, these experiences are discarded after training."

I want to remove all single letter words from the dataset as most of these are most likely accidental searches and there is no point on training the agent on single letters as there is no second letter to predict. I also removed words longer than 16 characters so I could later on pad all words to a reasonable size. 10 was a bit too short as some common words will be longer than 10 character but 15 was way more reasonable."

The reward was aroung 0.9 when I started and got up to about 0.15 after 30 minutes so it looks like I've hit some sort of limitation, either because the training data is too large or because my pytorch module could be inadequate. It might also just not be possible to get to 1 average reward because 2 words can start the same but still have a different next letter. at that point it is just up to the agent as to what next letter gets chosen"
