    "In this notebook I'm going to show my process of making a reinforcement learning agent that will guess the next letter in a string and potentially use it for autocomplete. I decided to do this project because I wanted to do a non gaming related reinforcement learning project. I know that there are better ways to do autocomplete but I'm curious if reinforcement learning would work. The project will be using a PPO model that I will create using pytorch and chatgpt. The reason for this choice is because I used a PPO model in my previous project and I want to get a better understanding of how it works"
